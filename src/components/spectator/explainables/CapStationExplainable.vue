  <Explainable term="Cap Station">
    <p>
      At a cap station a robot can pick up cap-carriers from the station's
      shelf. The Station then can retrieve it's cap and later mount it to a
      different product.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>
        Each shelf of a cap station initially holds 3 cap-carriers, which are
        special
      </span>
      <WorkpieceExplainable />
      <span>
        that consist of a clear (transparent) base and either a grey or black
        cap. A human may replenish the shelf every time it is empty. Each team
        has two cap stations, one with cap-carriers holding black cap, and one
        with cap-carriers holding grey caps.
      </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Once a cap-carrier is placed at the input, a robot may request the machine
      to retrieve it's cap, buffering it until later usage. the cap-less
      cap-carrier is transported to the machine's output, ready for pickup. It
      is not needed to fulfill orders directly, but can be used for payments at
      the
      <RingStationExplainable />, or alternatively can be discarded at the
      <DeliveryStationExplainable />. Each cap station can only buffer one cap
      at a time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once a cap is buffered in the cap station, the robot can deliver a
      workpiece at the input and request the machine to mount the stored cap
      onto the workpiece.
