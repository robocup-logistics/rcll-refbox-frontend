  <Explainable term="Ring Station">
    <p>
      <span> At a ring station, a robot can put a </span>
      <WorkpieceExplainable />
      <span>
        at a input and choose the ring color it wants to be mounted onto the
        workpiece.
      </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that some ring colors require a payment in the form of a number of
      bases. In this case, the robot has to put the bases for payment at a slide
      on the machine before it asks the machine to mount the ring. After the
      mount, the robot can pick up the new workpiece at the output.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each slide accepts at most 3 payments. Once this threshold is reached,
      payments need to be consumed through mounting rings that require payment.
      A human may empty the slide once it is full.
